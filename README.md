Abstract:

In this study, we introduce a novel Quantum-enhanced Feature Extraction and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) framework for pancreatic cancer detection. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with high-dimensional data, making feature selection and dimensionality reduction crucial for improving predictive performance. Our approach leverages Quantum-enhanced PCA to transform features into a more informative subspace, subsequently feeding them into classical classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM).
A key contribution of our research is the analysis of Bloch sphere representations, where we identify that quantum rotational gates (X, Y, Z) significantly impact classification accuracy, with the Y-rotation gate yielding the most favorable results in terms of accuracy and loss. Additionally, we investigate the impact of circuit depth, revealing that an optimal number of quantum layers (n_layers = 4) serves as a balance between accuracy and complexity, beyond which performance deteriorates. Our experimental results demonstrate that Quantum-enhanced RF achieves an 11% higher accuracy compared to AdaBoost, underscoring the superiority of quantum feature extraction over classical techniques. Furthermore, by integrating interpretability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and feature importance analysis, we provide insights into the most influential features contributing to the modelâ€™s decision-making process, reinforcing the potential of hybrid quantum-classical models for AI-driven medical diagnostics.
